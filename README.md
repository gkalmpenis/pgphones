## Installation
This application is suggested to be installed with the help of **XAMPP** (https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).

2. Now we must place the application files in the Apache server. The path is usually _C:\xampp\htdocs_ and inside _htdocs_ we place the folder _pgphones_.

3. After we initiate the service of _Apache_ and _MySQL_ from xampp the application is ready to use. It runs on the address _localhost:port/pgphones_ ,where port is the endpoint in which our Apache server runs.
